                                      Line a sieve with a coffee filter and
                                      place over a pitcher. Strain coffee into
                                      pitcher (do not stir); discard solids.
                                      Stir in 1 can sweetened condensed milk and
                                      vanilla extract. If you like your coffee
                                      sweeter, add more milk.
