Meaning, just because they are ready to be broken down it doesn't mean that they\_ARE\_breaking down. Yes, your body is in a constant state of burning fats for energy and a higher metabolism means a high rate of fats being burnt for energy, these figures are so minuscule that you will\_NEVER\_see a physical result to your waistline through this alone.\_There are studies showing that caffeine increases your resting metabolic rate by\_3–11%, with larger doses having a greater effect! In the short term, this is great! After a while people build up a tolerance to the effects and it stops working. One study showed that caffeine increased fat burning by as much as\_29%\_in lean people, while the increase was only about\_10%\_in obese people. The effect also appears to decrease with age and is greater in younger individuals. You could argue that by drinking\_ROBUSTA\_coffee you are doubling your caffeine intake, therefore doubling your RMR (resting metabolic rate). Is this worth it? I would tend to stick with a high quality arabica for the taste, than to grimace through robusta coffee for a slight increase in my resting metabolic rate.\_"

However, another study showed\_no\_effect for men. So really it is just a personal thing.\_In a basic sense, it makes sense that having\_SOMETHING\_in your belly is better than having nothing.

A single cup (250ml) of black coffee comes at a\_WHOPPING\_4 calories! Most of you will add a dash of milk, and this bumps it up to around 15-20 calories a cup.The caffeine is realistically doing nothing to your waistline, it is purely the lack of calories doing the work and the fact that you're essentially starving yourself into a better weight isn’t my favorite method of weight loss. But hey, everyone is different and everyone has their own way of doing things, i would just err on the side of caution on this one.\_Sugars and sweeteners blow these numbers way higher!

Most of you will add a dash of milk, and this bumps it up to around 15-20 calories a cup.The caffeine is realistically doing nothing to your waistline, it is purely the lack of calories doing the work and the fact that you're essentially starving yourself into a better weight isn’t my favorite method of weight loss.

Meaning, just because they are ready to be broken down it doesn't mean that they\_ARE\_breaking down. Yes, your body is in a constant state of burning fats for energy and a higher metabolism means a high rate of fats being burnt for energy, these figures are so minuscule that you will\_NEVER\_see a physical result to your waistline through this alone.\_There are studies showing that caffeine increases your resting metabolic rate by\_3–11%, with larger doses having a greater effect! In the short term, this is great! After a while people build up a tolerance to the effects and it stops working. One study showed that caffeine increased fat burning by as much as\_29%\_in lean people, while the increase was only about\_10%\_in obese people. The effect also appears to decrease with age and is greater in younger individuals. You could argue that by drinking\_ROBUSTA\_coffee you are doubling your caffeine intake, therefore doubling your RMR (resting metabolic rate). Is this worth it? I would tend to stick with a high quality arabica for the taste, than to grimace through robusta coffee for a slight increase in my resting metabolic rate.\_"
