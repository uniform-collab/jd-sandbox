                      Water is essential for all life on earth, however we rely
                      on a balance of water to sustain life. Too little and we
                      dry up, too much and we flood.

                      do with my COFFEE?

                      Like all fine things in life, complex flavors rely on
                      balance to really bring to life all the amazing tastes and
                      sensations. The same applies to coffee, with its inability
                      to cope with unbalanced or over balanced dosing.

                      I tend to refer to coffee as being allergic to the 21st
                      century, and if you thought hipsters were fussy about
                      their coffee, you’ll be surprised to know that their
                      coffee is WAY more fussy than they are!

                      Lets focus on RATIOs. Specifically the WATER:COFFEE ratio
                      in both your BASKET and your CUP!

                      Let’s assume you have a 16g basket (most breville,
                      delonghi and sunbeam baskets are 16g-18g). If you are
                      unsure, go have a quick read of your manual and come back.

                      Now if you have a 16g basket you are wanting to add 16g of
                      ground coffee into your basket, and hoping for 32ml of
                      espresso pouring out the other end.

                      This is a guide, not a rule, the bigger that basket means
                      more grinds and more espresso. We have a 22g basket in the
                      Cafe, and we run 22.5g In, hoping for a 50ml extraction.
                      Adjust the guide to your machine and preference, whilst
                      keeping as much to this ratio as possible

                      All of this, however, should be done within an extraction
                      time of about 30-35 Seconds. Almost every espresso coffee
                      is made in the golden 30 Second timer, and is just the
                      best output when placed against HEAT and PRESSURE. Science
                      tells us that coffee cannot taste good if the time it
                      extracts in is any more or any less than 30 seconds,
                      however that is a can of worms we can open another day!

                      Now that you have your perfect golden ratio espresso, and
                      you are pouring that beautifully made espresso into your
                      cup. The best way to get the best flavors is finding an
                      8oz cup, for your 1oz of espresso. Adding 7oz of water,
                      milk, whatever, into your 1oz of espresso creates the
                      perfect balance of coffee to additive ratio.

                      Obviously if you are playing along at home, you won’t be
                      scientifically measuring how many ounces your coffee cups
                      are, I recommend finding your favorite and adjusting to
                      taste from there. (Everyone should have a favorite coffee
                      cup, it’s part of adulthood). A standard cup being 250ml
                      will do, however 7oz is around the 200ml mark, again the
                      ratio is a GUIDE rather than a RULE!

                      And that’s that, a perfectly ratioed cup of coffee in its
                      purest form. Now keep in mind a larger cup will require
                      more coffee, however as long as you are following the
                      GOLDEN RATIO you are good as gold!

                      Water is essential for all life on earth, however we rely
                      on a balance of water to sustain life. Too little and we
                      dry up, too much and we flood.

                      Like all fine things in life, complex flavors rely on
                      balance to really bring to life all the amazing tastes and
                      sensations. The same applies to coffee, with its inability
                      to cope with unbalanced or over balanced dosing.

                      I tend to refer to coffee as being allergic to the 21st
                      century, and if you thought hipsters were fussy about
                      their coffee, you’ll be surprised to know that their
                      coffee is WAY more fussy than they are!

                      Let’s assume you have a 16g basket (most breville,
                      delonghi and sunbeam baskets are 16g-18g). If you are
                      unsure, go have a quick read of your manual and come back.

                      Now if you have a 16g basket you are wanting to add 16g of
                      ground coffee into your basket, and hoping for 32ml of
                      espresso pouring out the other end.

                      This is a guide, not a rule, the bigger that basket means
                      more grinds and more espresso. We have a 22g basket in the
                      Cafe, and we run 22.5g In, hoping for a 50ml extraction.
                      Adjust the guide to your machine and preference, whilst
                      keeping as much to this ratio as possible

                      All of this, however, should be done within an extraction
                      time of about 30-35 Seconds. Almost every espresso coffee
                      is made in the golden 30 Second timer, and is just the
                      best output when placed against HEAT and PRESSURE. Science
                      tells us that coffee cannot taste good if the time it
                      extracts in is any more or any less than 30 seconds,
                      however that is a can of worms we can open another day!

                      Now that you have your perfect golden ratio espresso, and
                      you are pouring that beautifully made espresso into your
                      cup. The best way to get the best flavors is finding an
                      8oz cup, for your 1oz of espresso. Adding 7oz of water,
                      milk, whatever, into your 1oz of espresso creates the
                      perfect balance of coffee to additive ratio.

                      Obviously if you are playing along at home, you won’t be
                      scientifically measuring how many ounces your coffee cups
                      are, I recommend finding your favorite and adjusting to
                      taste from there. (Everyone should have a favorite coffee
                      cup, it’s part of adulthood). A standard cup being 250ml
                      will do, however 7oz is around the 200ml mark, again the
                      ratio is a GUIDE rather than a RULE!

                      And that’s that, a perfectly ratioed cup of coffee in its
                      purest form. Now keep in mind a larger cup will require
                      more coffee, however as long as you are following the
                      GOLDEN RATIO you are good as gold!

                      Like all fine things in life, complex flavors rely on
                      balance to really bring to life all the amazing tastes and
                      sensations. The same applies to coffee, with its inability
                      to cope with unbalanced or over balanced dosing.

                      I tend to refer to coffee as being allergic to the 21st
                      century, and if you thought hipsters were fussy about
                      their coffee, you’ll be surprised to know that their
                      coffee is WAY more fussy than they are!

                      Let’s assume you have a 16g basket (most breville,
                      delonghi and sunbeam baskets are 16g-18g). If you are
                      unsure, go have a quick read of your manual and come back.

                      Now if you have a 16g basket you are wanting to add 16g of
                      ground coffee into your basket, and hoping for 32ml of
                      espresso pouring out the other end.

                      This is a guide, not a rule, the bigger that basket means
                      more grinds and more espresso. We have a 22g basket in the
                      Cafe, and we run 22.5g In, hoping for a 50ml extraction.
                      Adjust the guide to your machine and preference, whilst
                      keeping as much to this ratio as possible

                      All of this, however, should be done within an extraction
                      time of about 30-35 Seconds. Almost every espresso coffee
                      is made in the golden 30 Second timer, and is just the
                      best output when placed against HEAT and PRESSURE. Science
                      tells us that coffee cannot taste good if the time it
                      extracts in is any more or any less than 30 seconds,
                      however that is a can of worms we can open another day!

                      Now that you have your perfect golden ratio espresso, and
                      you are pouring that beautifully made espresso into your
                      cup. The best way to get the best flavors is finding an
                      8oz cup, for your 1oz of espresso. Adding 7oz of water,
                      milk, whatever, into your 1oz of espresso creates the
                      perfect balance of coffee to additive ratio.

                      Obviously if you are playing along at home, you won’t be
                      scientifically measuring how many ounces your coffee cups
                      are, I recommend finding your favorite and adjusting to
                      taste from there. (Everyone should have a favorite coffee
                      cup, it’s part of adulthood). A standard cup being 250ml
                      will do, however 7oz is around the 200ml mark, again the
                      ratio is a GUIDE rather than a RULE!

                      And that’s that, a perfectly ratioed cup of coffee in its
                      purest form. Now keep in mind a larger cup will require
                      more coffee, however as long as you are following the
                      GOLDEN RATIO you are good as gold!

                      on a balance of water to sustain life. Too little and we
                      dry up, too much and we flood.

                      Like all fine things in life, complex flavors rely on
                      balance to really bring to life all the amazing tastes and
                      sensations. The same applies to coffee, with its inability
                      to cope with unbalanced or over balanced dosing.

                      I tend to refer to coffee as being allergic to the 21st
                      century, and if you thought hipsters were fussy about
                      their coffee, you’ll be surprised to know that their
                      coffee is WAY more fussy than they are!

                      Let’s assume you have a 16g basket (most breville,
                      delonghi and sunbeam baskets are 16g-18g). If you are
                      unsure, go have a quick read of your manual and come back.

                      Now if you have a 16g basket you are wanting to add 16g of
                      ground coffee into your basket, and hoping for 32ml of
                      espresso pouring out the other end.

                      This is a guide, not a rule, the bigger that basket means
                      more grinds and more espresso. We have a 22g basket in the
                      Cafe, and we run 22.5g In, hoping for a 50ml extraction.
                      Adjust the guide to your machine and preference, whilst
                      keeping as much to this ratio as possible

                      All of this, however, should be done within an extraction
                      time of about 30-35 Seconds. Almost every espresso coffee
                      is made in the golden 30 Second timer, and is just the
                      best output when placed against HEAT and PRESSURE. Science
                      tells us that coffee cannot taste good if the time it
                      extracts in is any more or any less than 30 seconds,
                      however that is a can of worms we can open another day!

                      Now that you have your perfect golden ratio espresso, and
                      you are pouring that beautifully made espresso into your
                      cup. The best way to get the best flavors is finding an
                      8oz cup, for your 1oz of espresso. Adding 7oz of water,
                      milk, whatever, into your 1oz of espresso creates the
                      perfect balance of coffee to additive ratio.

                      Obviously if you are playing along at home, you won’t be
                      scientifically measuring how many ounces your coffee cups
                      are, I recommend finding your favorite and adjusting to
                      taste from there. (Everyone should have a favorite coffee
                      cup, it’s part of adulthood). A standard cup being 250ml
                      will do, however 7oz is around the 200ml mark, again the
                      ratio is a GUIDE rather than a RULE!

                      And that’s that, a perfectly ratioed cup of coffee in its
                      purest form. Now keep in mind a larger cup will require
                      more coffee, however as long as you are following the
                      GOLDEN RATIO you are good as gold!
