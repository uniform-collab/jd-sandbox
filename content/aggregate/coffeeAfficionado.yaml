  Aficionado is a person who enjoys, is knowledgeable about, and values a
  particular interest or activity.


  So basically, a coffee connoisseur or aficionado knows everything there is to
  know about coffee. This means you are familiar with different roasts. It is
  clear what type of bean is in front of you (and where it comes from). You also
  know the different flavours of those beans, the different ways to brew them in
  a cup, and the speciality drinks you can make with them.


  Moreover, you're always up to date with the latest coffee trends.


  However, you might askâ€“ what's the point of an aficionado trying something new
  if they already know which beans, flavours, and brew methods they prefer?


  A coffee connoisseur has tried everything. There is no denying that they know
  what they like and how to make it. But what makes it enjoyable for them is the
  process of making coffee and the satisfaction they get from the finished
  product.
